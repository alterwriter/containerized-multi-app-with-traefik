# containerized-multi-app-with-traefik

This is a sample setup for running multiple containerized apps with Traefik as the middleware.

If you encounter errors while running the applications, it means you need to update your configurations.

This is a SAMPLE configuration — don’t expect it to work out-of-the-box for every setup. I’m just sharing the logic behind how Traefik works. You’ll need to tweak it based on your specific app configurations.

Cheerz!
